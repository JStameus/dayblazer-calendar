# Dayblazer Calendar
A calendar and planner app where you can take on optional side-quests, collect
achievements and make life a little more adventurous!

This is a school project, where the task is to create a full-stack application
using Nodejs, HTML and CSS, with the end result being a usable calendar of some
sort.

## Overview

This is the client-side part of the project, which contains the user interface
and all interactive parts.

Dayblazer Calendar works like a regular calendar, allowing the user to create
events, set deadlines, and get an overview of weeks, months or years. While you
could choose to only use it like a regular calendar, it also has a few
gamificaiton features that turns it into a full-fledged quest log for the
everyday adventurer!

As you go about your daily routines, you can choose an "Adventure Track", which
will give you neat little side-quests, such a learning a new recipe, finding a
neat rock, taking a picture at sunset, and so on. Completing your own tasks will
net you experience points, which advances your chosen Adventure Track and
unlocks new challenges - and new rewards! 

Completing these "quests" will give you badges and achievements to display on
your profile, where you can keep track of how many badges you've earned, how
much total XP you have, how many of your own tasks you've completed, and much
more!

The goal is to make everyday life a little more exciting, and give users
opportunities to try new things that they wouldn't otherwise.
